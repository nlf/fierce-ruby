This is a library for parsing output from fierce2. It turns all of the available information
into ruby objects to make it as easy as possible to iterate through. Please see known issues

Example usage:
fierce -dns google.com -format xml -output google.xml

require('fierce-ruby')
in_file = File.open("google.xml")
doc = REXML::Document.new(in_file)
dscan = DomainScan.new(doc.root.elements["domainscan"])
p dscan.whois
